description='''
A client-side utility mod that automates your combat. Uses a smart auto attack that targets hostile mobs when you look at them.

It also includes an automatic shield equip that moves a shield to your offhand when projectile-firing mobs are nearby. Both features are fully customizable and can be toggled with in-game keybinds.

Note: This is NOT to be used for cheating, hence the absence of player attacking.
