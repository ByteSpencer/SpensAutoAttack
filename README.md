# Spen's Auto Attack Mod

A client-side utility mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that automates your combat.

![example(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a519fa6-e369-4b6e-9b67-df1bea70d327)


## Features
* **Smart Auto Attack:** Automatically attacks hostile mobs when you look at them (with your crosshair)
* **Auto-Equip Shield:** When projectile-firing mobs are nearby (Skeletons, Ghasts, Pillagers, etc.) it automatically moves a shield from your hotbar to your offhand
* **Fully Configurable:** Both features are fully customizable and can be toggled with in-game keybinds.
  A detailed config menu (compatible with Configured by MrCrayfish) allows you to choose exactly which mobs trigger each feature

## Note: This is a utility mod designed for standard gameplay. It is not intended for use as a cheat, which is why it does not attack other players !!

## Installation
1.  Make sure you have Forge for Minecraft 1.20.1 installed.
2.  Download the latest `.jar` file from the Releases page.
3.  Place the `.jar` file into your Minecraft `mods` folder.


I recommend using SpammyCombat by PaintNinja (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spammycombat) alongside this mod ATM, until I update the auto attack timing

## FAQ
* Q = Does the auto attack **work for animals?**
* A = **No !** It only works for entities with the **"monster" tag** (https://minecraft.wiki/w/Monster)
* Q = Will the shield equip auto **deflect projectiles** for me?
* A = It will not raise the shield for you. **The blocking is still 100% your control.**
* Q = Can I keep the **shield in my inventory?**
* A = **No !** You must keep a shield in your **hot bar,** slots 1-9 for the mod to auto throw it into your offhand

## Future Development

1. updating this mod to current versions of mc
2. having auto attack work with endermen and zombie piglins
3. shield durability warning / on screen status HUD
4. more mob options (animals)
5. having shield auto block projectiles 
6. timed attacks for auto attack
